# RTL_Projects

Welcome to **RTL_Projects** â€” a collection of Verilog RTL (Register Transfer Level) design projects aimed at mastering digital design through simulation and waveform analysis.

This repository contains multiple Verilog projects, each with its own source code and testbench files. All projects are designed to be simulated using **Icarus Verilog** and visualized using **GTKWave**.

---

## Repository Structure
Each project folder contains:
- The Verilog source code file(s) (`*.v`)
- The corresponding testbench file(s) (`*_tb.v`)
- A project-specific README explaining the design and usage (`README.md`)
- waveform dumpfile (`*.vcd`)
- vvp output/simulation file (`*.vvp`)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Icarus Verilog** (iverilog)  
- **GTKWave** (Waveform Analyzer)
- **VSCode** or any editor
